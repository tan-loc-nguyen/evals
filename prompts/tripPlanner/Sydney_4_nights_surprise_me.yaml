  Your task is to create a detailed daily travel itinerary.

user_prompt: |-
  I'm going to {{hotel_city}} for {{number_of_nights}} nights between {{check_in_date}} and {{check_out_date}}, with {{number_of_adults}} adult(s).
  I'm staying at {{hotel_name}}.

  I'd like specific activities. Eg. "Cultural Immersion Day" is not specific, but "Visit the Eiffel Tower" is specific.

  For some of the activities, include an insider tip. Eg. for the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney, you might add:
  "Insider tip: Walk all the way out to Mrs Macquarie's Chair for the best unobstructed view of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge together - perfect for photos without the tour groups."
  No need to add a tip for every activity, perhaps for about a third of them. And, only if you have a genuinely useful tip.

  I'd like a specific restaurant recommendation for each evening. (Do not add an insider tip for restaurants, cafés, bars, or any other meal recommendations)

  Most activities can have a fairly short description. For the highlight activities though, include a longer description. A few sentences is fine.

  Make sure each activity includes the name of the place. This might be a landmark, a place, or an establishment. It's what I'd search for to find it on Google Maps, Google Places, etc.

  Can you also make sure that each activity has a start time?










  So remember:
  - A great overall trip, that considers my preferences but isn't totally dominated by them
  - Specific activities on each day
  - Insider tips for activities, but not for restaurants, cafés, bars, or any other meal recommendations
  - Longer descriptions for highlight activities
  - A specific restaurant recommendation for each evening
  - The place name or location for each activity (it might be the name of an establishment, a landmark, or a place - the thing I'd search for on Google Maps, Google Places, etc.)
